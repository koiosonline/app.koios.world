    "fullDescription": "The course “Programming Dapps” teaches students to program distributed applications (DAPPS) for the public Ethereum blockchain. After explaining the architecture of blockchain applications, the programming language “Solidity” is explained. With this student practice to create a smart contract, with several dedicated tools. They also learn how to access the smart contracts from JavaScript programs and websites; both from pc’s and from mobile phones. The installation and management of blockchain software is also part of the course. Additionally programming patterns, security, key management and best practices are learned. This also includes creating unit tests for smart contracts. Building blocks like tokens, the Ethereum name services, IPFS (distributed storage), multisig wallets are also an essential element of the course. It is important to be able to program (in any programming language). JavaScript experience is a big help. Also you need a (fairly capable) laptop on which all the tools are installed. After every theory lesson the student have to make practical assignment to get experience with the Ethereum blockchain and tools.",
